Automated Face Recognition Based Monitoring System

Abstract: -

Security is one of the biggest concerns of this technology driven era. With increase in the available resources one has to keep track, for that we use multiple channels to be up to date with those logs. Channels like CCTV which are widely used till now to monitor the track. This is one of the most accurate techniques which is widely used. But one of the exhausting necessities of this channel is manpower and separate hardware resources.

The project “Automated Face Recognition based Monitoring System” is a Python based application aimed towards the modern way of monitoring or surveillance system. This system work on the basis of face recognition and face detection. After the successful recognition it will generate a log file that will show the daily record of that person in the premises.
